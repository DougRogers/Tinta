# Tinta Prerelease
Tinta is an image and video organization tool insipred by Picasa.  It will scan all your hard drives for images and videos and let you scroll though them all in a single window.

Tinta is in pre-release at version 9.31.  This is the first public release.  While Tinta has been tested on a small scall, there may be issues and/or crashes when more people use it with different configuations than we have access to.  Our first priority is to resolve issues.

You can create albums, search the filename, import images and videos from portable devices (phones/tablets), tag files and much more.

Bugs:
  Please report any issues you are having with reporduction steps, if possible.
  
Crashes.
  Some crashes are able to be reported.  When that happens, a dialog box will pop up asking you to upload the crash data.  Please do so.  It will help identifying issues.
  
Feature Requests:
  While feature requests are welcome, currently, stability is the highest priority.  Feature request will be reviewed after full release, version 1.00, but please create an "issue" for a feature request.
  
Untested areas:
  Randomly unplugging USB drives when they are being accessed has not been thoughly tested.  This may cause issues.
