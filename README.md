# Tinta Release

www.lightpointsoftware.com

Tinta is an image and video organization tool inspired by Picasa.  It will scan all your hard drives for images and videos and let you scroll through them all in a single window.

Tinta is in released at version 1.0.43.  If you encounter any issues and/or crashes when more people use it with different configurations than we have access to.  Our first priority is to resolve issues.

You can create albums, search the filename, import images, and videos from portable devices (phones/tablets), tag files, and much more.

Bugs:
  Please report any issues you are having with reproduction steps, if possible.
  
Crashes.
  Some crashes are able to be reported.  When that happens, a dialog box will pop up asking you to upload the crash data.  Please do so.  It will help identify issues.
  
Feature Requests:
   Please create an "issue" for a feature request.
  
Untested areas:
  Randomly unplugging USB drives when they are being accessed has not been thoroughly tested.  This may cause issues.

About the ads:
  To support the development of Tinta, I have placed ads in Tinta.  We have endeavored to make them as unobtrusive as possible.  You can support Tinta development by clicking on the ads and visiting a sponsor.  Tinta is free and always will be, the ads are just to cover development.
